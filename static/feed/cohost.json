            "content_html": "<p>I&#x27;ve been sick the past two weeks.  Nothing too bad, just a cold.  But as a result I haven&#x27;t been doing any shows or recording.</p>\n<p>Today though I&#x27;m back!  I&#x27;m recording a very old song of mine called Tea and Scones.  I honestly don&#x27;t remember what it was about at the time.  But reading it now, I take the lyrics to be about prioritizing civility over action.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tea and scones<br/>\nLeave me alone</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But also a little teenage post break up angst</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Happy school girl<br/>\nDon&#x27;t you laugh at me parading<br/>\nYou love the funny man<br/>\nBut you really love to hate him<br/>\nI feel dead and I am drowning in success<br/>\nGoing green inside with my jealous lips and jealous eyes</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It feels a little Nirvana and a little bit country.</p>\n<p>Some of the lyrics need some workshopping.. anyway we&#x27;ll see how it goes.  It&#x27;s just nice to be out of bed!</p><hr/>\n<h4>Update: Mixing thoughts / struggles</h4>\n<p>I pretty indulgently spent almost all of today mixing this song instead of doing my real job.  I have this theory though that if my brain is really focused on some productive thing, I may as well just take advantage of that instead of being unproductive on the &quot;right&quot; task.  Hopefully then my brain gets obsessed with the thing I&#x27;m meant to be doing instead once the stack has been cleared.</p>\n<p>This was the first time I really tried to pay serious attention to LUFS / volume normalization.  My main take away from this session has been, having distinct tracks for different dynamics is helpful, but far more helpful is put your compression / limiters / gates on those groups instead of trying to do it globally.</p>\n<p>I wasted a lot of time trying to save time.  I thought I could put a lot of compressors and gates on the entire group of vocals, or the entire group of guitar tracks, but it just lead to a loss of clarity.</p>\n<p>I&#x27;m also starting to really appreciate / understand why all the music production nerds in my life spend so long trying to get levels / dynamics correct before you even start recording.  As I was mixing this I kept thinking, if I just was further back from the mic, I wouldn&#x27;t need to remove this bass.  Or if I didn&#x27;t use a plectrum here, there&#x27;d be a lot less artifacts in the guitar mix.</p>\n<p>I think over time you just build an intuition on how to save yourself time and I don&#x27;t have that yet, or not enough.</p>\n<h4>Monitors? Wonderboom</h4>\n<p>Before showing my girlfriend my first mix, I spent a good 2 hours with headphones getting all the levels right.  Then I played it on her little bluetooth speaker and the vocals were so loud.  I still can&#x27;t believe the difference in dynamics between headphones and speakers.  It always surprises me.</p>\n<p>So this mix, I only used the wonderboom.  I&#x27;ll go back after this pass and listen on various things, but as a baseline I wanted to use this thing because it has such variation in dynamics and its a pretty common / popular bluetooth speaker that is probably similar to a lot of other speaker people use.</p>\n<p>After this mix, I&#x27;ll not play too much with levels but instead focus on qualitative things like fades, or de-essing, or eq and listen in the car and with headphones.</p>\n<p>Not too interesting or surprising but I thought I&#x27;d mention it.</p>",

            "summary": "I've been sick the past two weeks. Nothing too bad, just a cold. But as a result I haven't been doing any shows or recording.\n\nToday though I'm back! I'm recording a very old song of mine called Tea and Scones. I honestly don't remember what it was about at the time. But reading it now, I take the lyrics to be about prioritizing civility over action.\n\n> Tea and scones\n> Leave me alone\n\nBut also a little teenage post break up angst\n\n> Happy school girl\n> Don't you laugh at me parading\n> You love the funny man\n> But you really love to hate him\n> I feel dead and I am drowning in success\n> Going green inside with my jealous lips and jealous eyes\n\nIt feels a little Nirvana and a little bit country.\n\nSome of the lyrics need some workshopping.. anyway we'll see how it goes. It's just nice to be out of bed!\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nUPDATE: MIXING THOUGHTS / STRUGGLES\n\nI pretty indulgently spent almost all of today mixing this song instead of doing my real job. I have this theory though that if my brain is really focused on some productive thing, I may as well just take advantage of that instead of being unproductive on the \"right\" task. Hopefully then my brain gets obsessed with the thing I'm meant to be doing instead once the stack has been cleared.\n\nThis was the first time I really tried to pay serious attention to LUFS / volume normalization. My main take away from this session has been, having distinct tracks for different dynamics is helpful, but far more helpful is put your compression / limiters / gates on those groups instead of trying to do it globally.\n\nI wasted a lot of time trying to save time. I thought I could put a lot of compressors and gates on the entire group of vocals, or the entire group of guitar tracks, but it just lead to a loss of clarity.\n\nI'm also starting to really appreciate / understand why all the music production nerds in my life spend so long trying to get levels / dynamics correct before you even start recording. As I was mixing this I kept thinking, if I just was further back from the mic, I wouldn't need to remove this bass. Or if I didn't use a plectrum here, there'd be a lot less artifacts in the guitar mix.\n\nI think over time you just build an intuition on how to save yourself time and I don't have that yet, or not enough.\n\nMONITORS? WONDERBOOM\n\nBefore showing my girlfriend my first mix, I spent a good 2 hours with headphones getting all the levels right. Then I played it on her little bluetooth speaker and the vocals were so loud. I still can't believe the difference in dynamics between headphones and speakers. It always surprises me.\n\nSo this mix, I only used the wonderboom. I'll go back after this pass and listen on various things, but as a baseline I wanted to use this thing because it has such variation in dynamics and its a pretty common / popular bluetooth speaker that is probably similar to a lot of other speaker people use.\n\nAfter this mix, I'll not play too much with levels but instead focus on qualitative things like fades, or de-essing, or eq and listen in the car and with headphones.\n\nNot too interesting or surprising but I thought I'd mention it.",

I didn&#x27;t know of his connections to many other important leftist figures.</p>\n<p>And after learning of all that, I had it on my to-do list to get up to speed on his work and his eventual drift to the right and support of the war in Iraq.</p>\n<p>Having just put it down this morning, I might think of more to say later, but my overall impression was that he didn&#x27;t drift to the right so much as differed from the left on some key issues.

It isn&#x27;t paranoia.  But neither is it always logical to just say &quot;America Bad&quot;.  And for Hitchens, someone who had a deep love for America, and someone so often embedded in countries without democracy, it would have been jarring to register this automatic skepticism in his colleagues.</p>\n<p>I can empathize with Hitchen&#x27;s will to consistently follow his own internal logic, to change his opinions as he encountered new data, or at least anecdata.

E.g. pulchritudinous?  It means beautiful.</p>\n<p>There is a lot of needless french phases thrown in, endlessly.  You get the feeling he just really wants the reader to love him, to be impressed.  He wants to be remembered.</p>\n<p>I can&#x27;t fault him for that, but it doesn&#x27;t make for great reading.</p>\n<p>And that isn&#x27;t to say I don&#x27;t like to expand my vocabulary.
